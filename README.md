# Advent of Code 2023

Solving [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) with [Bun](https://bun.sh/) on [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io).

## Running samples

Visit the [project on codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/h3rmanj/aoc-2023) to run in a terminal in the browser.

Each day has a separate folder, containing a `first.js` and `second.js` for each part.

```bash
# run part one of day 3
bun 03/first.js
```

## Remarks

None of this code is meant to be read.
I've just thrown shit on the wall until the wall has the correct number of shits.
